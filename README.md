MPC-chord-finder
========

It's a tool to locate chords on the Akai MPCs pads.

As you have at least 12 Pads (MPC500), you'll be able to play a lot of chords on a MPC.  
Naturally you will end up playing mostly [inversions](http://goo.gl/ezboLg) of the chords.   
But that still works quite well with most songs.

The chords would work for any pitch a sample might have,
but i'd recommend to tune it so that you have PAD1 playing a C note.
